🔑 Suggested Role-Based Access

1. SuperAdmin

=> Full power → can manage everything.
=> But you mentioned earlier: SuperAdmin (Admin) cannot modify/delete Roles.

✅ Allowed:

=> Create, update, delete Users
=> Create, update, delete Parties
=> Assign Candidates
=> View all entities (Roles, Users, Parties, Candidates)

❌ Not Allowed:

=> Update/Delete Roles

---

2. SubAdmin

=> Limited power → can manage some entities but with restrictions.

✅ Allowed:

=> View all Roles (`GET /api/roles`, `GET /api/roles/{id}`)
=> Add/Update Users only if role = Candidate or SubAdmin (say roleId = 3 or 4)
=> Update Parties (but not delete)
=> View all Users and Parties

❌ Not Allowed:

=> Delete Roles
=> Delete Parties
=> Add/Delete Candidates

---

3. Candidate

=> Very restricted → can manage only their own profile.

✅ Allowed:

=> Update their own profile (`PUT /api/users/{userId}` with their ID)
=> View their own profile (`GET /api/users/{userId}` with their ID)

❌ Not Allowed:

=> Create/Delete Users
=> Manage Roles
=> Manage Parties
=> Assign Candidates

---
